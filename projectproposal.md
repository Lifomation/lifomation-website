## **Project Description**

Lifomation is an advanced web application designed to securely store and manage essential documents like health records, government IDs, tax forms, and personal documents. The platform leverages cutting-edge technology, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction from documents, and a robust search engine to enable users to quickly locate specific documents using natural language queries. Security and privacy are paramount, with conditional access controls allowing users to share documents selectively with authorized individuals, thereby simplifying document management and access.

## **Required Elements**

- **Frontend Framework:** React Next.js with TypeScript for a modern, type-safe user interface.
- **Backend API:** Express.js for building a RESTful API.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for reliable and scalable data storage.
- **ORM:** Sequelize for efficient database interaction.
- **Deployment:** Docker and Docker Compose for seamless deployment on a Virtual Machine, ensuring consistency and reproducibility. Deployment files will be committed to GitHub along with CI files for automated image building.
- **Public Accessibility:** The application will be fully accessible to the public without any additional steps or requirements.
- **Third-party API:** Integration with OpenAI's GPT API for natural language processing and document analysis.
- **OAuth 2.0:** Implementation of OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication and authorization.

## **Additional Requirements**

- **Webhook Integration:** A webhook will be utilized to trigger specific actions within the application based on external events.
- **Real-time Updates:** The application will incorporate real-time features to reflect changes made by other users without requiring manual page refreshes.

## **Alpha Version Milestone**

- **Frontend:** Basic UI components for document upload, viewing, and search.
- **Backend:** API endpoints for document management and authentication.
- **Database:** Initial database schema and data models.
- **Uplaod:** Set up database to ensure documents, and image uploading.
- **Figma:** Create initial design
- **Login/Signup:** Authenticate and create Users

## **Beta Version Milestone**

- **Search Functionality:** Implementation of a robust search engine.
- **Conditional Access Controls:** Development of access control mechanisms.
- **Deployment:** Initial deployment on a Virtual Machine using Docker.
- **OCR Integration:** Basic OCR functionality for text extraction.

## **Final Version Milestone**

- **Refinement:** Polish UI/UX, optimize performance, and conduct thorough testing.
- **Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation for the project.
- **Deployment:** Final deployment and configuration.

## **Tech Stack**
