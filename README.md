## Project Title

**Lifomation**

## Project Description

Lifomation is an advanced web application designed to securely store and manage essential documents, including health records, government IDs, tax forms, and other personal documents. Our platform integrates state-of-the-art technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction and a sophisticated search engine that supports natural language queries. This enables users to quickly and easily locate their documents. Security and privacy are our top priorities, with features that allow for conditional access controls, ensuring that users can share documents selectively and securely.

### What Lifomation Does

- **Document Storage:** Secure and organized storage for all your important documents.
- **OCR Integration:** Converts images of documents into searchable and editable text.
- **Advanced Search:** Allows users to find documents using intuitive, natural language queries.
- **Conditional Sharing:** Users can share documents with specific individuals under controlled conditions.
- **Real-time Updates:** Changes made by users are reflected immediately across the platform.

### **Technologies**

- **Frontend Framework:** Angular for a modern, type-safe user interface.
- **Backend API:** Express.js for building a RESTful API.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for reliable and scalable data storage.
- **ORM:** Sequelize for efficient database interaction.
- **Deployment:** Docker and Docker Compose for seamless deployment on a Virtual Machine, ensuring consistency and reproducibility. Deployment files will be committed to GitHub along with CI files for automated image building.
- **Public Accessibility:** The application will be fully accessible to the public without any additional steps or requirements.
- **Third-party API:** Integration with OpenAI's GPT API for natural language processing and document analysis.
- **OAuth 2.0:** Implementation of OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication and authorization.

### **Additional Requirements**

- **Webhook Integration:** A webhook will be utilized to trigger specific actions within the application based on external events where someone requests access to a document. For example, a doctor requesting access to your health records. 
- **Real-time Updates:** The application will incorporate real-time features, such as instant notifications for document access requests, approvals/denials, shared document updates, system alerts, and presence indicators, to reflect changes made by other users without requiring manual page refreshes.
- **OCR Integration:** Lifomation leverages advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to automatically convert scanned images or photos of documents into searchable and editable text. This process typically takes up to 10 seconds per document, depending on the document's size, complexity, and image quality.
- **Elastic Search:** Elastic Search enables users to quickly access documents through non-specifc/generalized search queries allowing for a seamless search experience.

### **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Express.js, Sequelize ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **API:** Elastic Search, GPT
- **Virtual Machine:** Docker
- **Security:** Auth0
- **Additional:** Webhook integration, real-time updates



### Challenges and Future Features
 **Alpha Version Milestone**

- **Frontend:** Basic UI components for document upload, viewing, and search.
- **Backend:** API endpoints for document management and authentication.
- **Database:** Initial database schema and data models.
- **Uplaod:** Set up database to ensure documents, and image uploading.
- **Figma:** Create initial design
- **Login/Signup:** Authenticate and create Users

 **Beta Version Milestone**

- **Search Functionality:** Implementation of a robust search engine.
- **Conditional Access Controls:** Development of access control mechanisms.
- **Deployment:** Initial deployment on a Virtual Machine using Docker.
- **OCR Integration:** Basic OCR functionality for text extraction.
