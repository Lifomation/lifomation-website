## Project Title

**Lifomation**

## Project Description

Lifomation is an advanced web application designed to securely store and manage essential documents, including health records, government IDs, tax forms, and other personal documents. Our platform integrates state-of-the-art technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction and a sophisticated search engine that supports natural language queries. This enables users to quickly and easily locate their documents. Security and privacy are our top priorities, with features that allow for conditional access controls, ensuring that users can share documents selectively and securely.

### What Lifomation Does

- **Document Storage:** Secure and organized storage for all your important documents.
- **OCR Integration:** Converts images of documents into searchable and editable text.
- **Advanced Search:** Allows users to find documents using intuitive, natural language queries.
- **Conditional Sharing:** Users can share documents with specific individuals under controlled conditions.
- **Real-time Updates:** Changes made by users are reflected immediately across the platform.

### Why We Chose These Technologies

- **Angular:** Provides a modern, dynamic, and scalable framework for our frontend, ensuring a responsive user interface.
- **Express.js:** Facilitates the creation of a robust and scalable RESTful API on the backend.
- **PostgreSQL:** Offers reliable and scalable data storage for complex queries and relationships.
- **Sequelize ORM:** Simplifies database interactions and management.
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** Ensures consistent deployment across different environments and simplifies the CI/CD process.
- **OpenAI GPT API:** Enhances our search capabilities with powerful natural language processing.
- **OAuth 2.0:** Provides secure user authentication and authorization.

### Challenges and Future Features

- **Challenges:**
  - Integrating real-time updates to ensure instant reflection of changes without refreshing.
  - Ensuring secure and scalable document storage and retrieval.
  - Developing robust and flexible access control mechanisms for document sharing.

- **Future Features:**
  - Enhanced AI capabilities for document summarization and categorization.
  - Mobile application development for on-the-go document management.
  - Integration with additional third-party services for broader functionality.
